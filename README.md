[Thursday 09:48] Arved Aksen
1 for adobe pdf service, for euroland company code "S-DOM"
[Thursday 09:48] Arved Aksen
I tested with this company PDF file: https://www.dometicgroup.com/globalassets/4-dometicgroup/investors/financial-reports/2023/dometic-q42023-report-eng.pdf?ref=3FD069CB85

[Thursday 09:59] Arved Aksen
currently this API creates C:\WISE\PDF\uploaded_pdfsv + euroland_companycode + pdf file for local pdf copy
[Thursday 09:59] Arved Aksen
and returned .zip file from Adobe service is saved under: C:\WISE\PDF\adobe_zip
[Thursday 10:00] Arved Aksen
2) After running second application: wise_parse_structured_pdf
[Thursday 10:02] Arved Aksen
it has hardcoded conf there, "currently" with data, 
run_conf
[Thursday 10:02] Arved Aksen
we need to make it more practical in the future
[Thursday 10:02] Arved Aksen
so it will take the Adobe zip file, for ex. 
C:\WISE\PDF\adobe_zip\S-DOM\dometic-q42023-report-eng.zip
[Thursday 10:03] Arved Aksen
unzip it and also parse all texts + excels
[Thursday 10:03] Arved Aksen
it will create folder "pages" where all pages are
[Thursday 10:04] Arved Aksen
and finally it will save data in: final_structure.json and parsed_data.json
[Thursday 10:04] Arved Aksen
this C:\WISE\PDF\adobe_zip\parsed_data.json is like conf file for next step which is
[Thursday 10:05] Arved Aksen
3) wise_finalise_pdf_texts
[Thursday 10:06] Arved Aksen
this will split texts into max size so it fits into max sequence lenght (512 this case)
[Thursday 10:06] Arved Aksen
and uploads into database
[Thursday 10:07] Arved Aksen
and finally. 4) wise_upload_data_to_vectordb
[Thursday 10:07] Arved Aksen
this will take the chunks, embedd it with model and upload it vector database
[Thursday 10:07] Arved Aksen
WISE.zip I send has this local embeddings models I used now
[Thursday 10:08] Arved Aksen
ps! dont run adobe pdf parsing service too many times as they have a counter and max limit per month per pages, so its better not to over use it
[Thursday 10:14] Arved Aksen
adobe keys are in the wise_adobe_pdf_extract project folder also, but can you make another account in adobe for same use case

https://developer.adobe.com/

[13:48] Arved Aksen

[13:49] Arved Aksen

[13:49] Arved Aksen
which is db dump
